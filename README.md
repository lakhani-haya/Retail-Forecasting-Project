# Retail Sales Forecasting using Prophet

This project uses Python and Facebook Prophet to forecast product category sales for a fictional retail dataset. It demonstrates how machine learning and business intelligence can work together to guide smarter inventory and marketing decisions.

---

## Project Objectives

- Forecast next 30 days of sales by product category (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Beauty)
- Identify seasonal trends and sales anomalies
- Prepare business-ready dashboards for decision-makers using Power BI

##  Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python (Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib)** | Data analysis and forecasting |
| **Prophet** | Time series forecasting per category |
| **Google Colab** | Interactive development environment |
| **Power BI** | Dashboard and KPI visualizations |
| **GitHub** | Project versioning and sharing |

## Forecasting Approach

1. Grouped historical sales by `Date` and `Product Category`
2. Built Prophet models per category to generate 30-day forecasts
3. Visualized each forecast and exported future values to `.csv`
4. Prepared Power BI visuals comparing actual vs forecasted performance
